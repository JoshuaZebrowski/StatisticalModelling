First part of a university project assignment regarding:

•	Using GIMP 2.0, created multiple slightly different images for a set of letter and non-letter symbols
•	Converted them into CSV files and used them to create one CSV file containing a row for each of the images, holding values for various different defined features
•	Using statistical analysis and multiple-linear regression modelling to determine the most discriminatory features
•	Using this data to predict whether or not a symbol is a letter or not
